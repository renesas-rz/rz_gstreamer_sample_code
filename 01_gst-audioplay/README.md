### Walkthrought

#### Input location
```
if (argc != ARG_COUNT)
{
  g_print ("Invalid arugments.\n");
  g_print ("Format: %s <path to file> \n", argv[ARG_PROGRAM_NAME]);
  return -1;
}
```
This application accepts one command-line argument which points to an Ogg/Vorbis file.

#### Create new pipeline
```
pipeline = gst_pipeline_new ("audio-play");
```
The _gst_pipeline_new()_ function creates a new empty pipeline which is the top-level container with clocking and bus management functionality.

#### Create elements
```
source = gst_element_factory_make ("filesrc", "file-source");
demuxer = gst_element_factory_make ("oggdemux", "ogg-demuxer");
decoder = gst_element_factory_make ("vorbisdec", "vorbis-decoder");
conv = gst_element_factory_make ("audioconvert", "converter");
capsfilter = gst_element_factory_make ("capsfilter", "conv_capsfilter");
sink = gst_element_factory_make ("autoaudiosink", "audio-output");
```
To play an Ogg/Vorbis audio file, the following elements are used:
-	 Element filesrc reads data from a local file.
-	 Element oggdemux de-multiplexes Ogg files into their encoded audio and video components. In this case, only audio stream is available.
-	 Element vorbisdec decompresses a Vorbis stream to raw audio.
-	 Element audioconvert converts raw audio buffers between various possible formats depending on the given source pad and sink pad it links to.
-	 Element capsfilter specifies raw audio format S16LE.
-	 Element autoaudiosink automatically detects an appropriate audio sink (such as: alsasink).

#### Check elements
```
if (!pipeline || !source || !demuxer || !decoder || !capsfilter || !conv || !sink) {
  g_printerr ("One element could not be created. Exiting.\n");
  return -1;
}
```
If either _gst_element_factory_make()_ or _gst_pipeline_new()_ is unable to create an element, NULL will be returned. Next, the application prints error and exit.
Note that this statement is used for reference purpose only. If an element cannot be created, the application should use _gst_object_unref()_ to free all created elements.

#### Set elementâ€™s properties
```
g_object_set (G_OBJECT (source), "location", input_file, NULL);
```
The _g_object_set()_ function is used to set the location property of filesrc (source) to an _Ogg/Vorbis_ file.
```
caps = gst_caps_new_simple ("audio/x-raw", "format", G_TYPE_STRING, FORMAT, NULL);

g_object_set (G_OBJECT (capsfilter), "caps", caps, NULL);
gst_caps_unref (caps);
```
Target audio format S16LE is added to a new cap (_gst_caps_new_simple_) which is then added to caps property of capsfilter (_g_object_set_). Then, audioconvert will use this element to convert audio format F32LE (of vorbisdec) to S16LE which is supported by sound driver.
Note that the caps should be freed with _gst_caps_unref()_ if it is not used anymore.

#### Build pipeline
```
gst_bin_add_many (GST_BIN (pipeline), source, demuxer, decoder, conv, capsfilter, sink, NULL);

gst_element_link (source, demuxer);
gst_element_link_many (decoder, conv, capsfilter, sink, NULL);
```
This code block adds all elements to pipeline and then links them into separated groups as below:
-	 Group #1: source and demuxer.
-	 Group #2: decoder, conv, capsfilter, and sink.
The reason for the separation is that demuxer (oggdemux) contains no source pads at this point, so it cannot link to decoder (vorbisdec) until pad-added signal is emitted (see below).
Note that the order counts, because links must follow the data flow (this is, from source elements to sink elements).

#### Signal

```
g_signal_connect (demuxer, "pad-added", G_CALLBACK (on_pad_added), decoder);
```
Signals are a crucial point in GStreamer. They allow you to be notified (by means of a callback) when something interesting has happened. Signals are identified by a name, and each element has its own signals.
In this application, _g_signal_connect()_ is used to bind pad-added signal of oggdemux (demuxer) to callback function _pad_added_handler()_ and decoder (vorbisdec). GStreamer does nothing with this element, it just forwards it to the callback. 

### Link oggdemux to vorbisdec
When oggdemux (demuxer) finally has enough information to start producing data, it will create source pads, and trigger the pad-added signal. At this point our callback will be called:
```
	static void on_pad_added (GstElement * element, GstPad * pad, gpointer data);
```
The element parameter is the GstElement which triggered the signal. In this application, it is oggdemux. The first parameter of a signal handler is always the object that has triggered it.
The pad parameter is the GstPad that has just been added to the oggdemux. This is usually the pad to which we want to link.
The data parameter is the decoder (vorbisdec) we provided earlier when attaching to the signal.
```
GstPad *sinkpad;
GstElement *decoder = (GstElement *) data;

sinkpad = gst_element_get_static_pad (decoder, "sink");
gst_pad_link (pad, sinkpad);
gst_object_unref (sinkpad);
```
The application retrieves the sink pad of vorbisdec using _gst_element_get_static_pad()_, then uses _gst_pad_link()_ to connect it to the source pad of oggdemux.
Note that sinkpad should be freed with _gst_caps_unref()_ if it is not used anymore.

### Play pipeline
```
gst_element_set_state (pipeline, GST_STATE_PLAYING);
```

Every pipeline has an associated state. To start audio playback, the pipeline needs to be set to PLAYING state.

### Wait until error or EOS
```
bus = gst_element_get_bus (pipeline);
msg = gst_bus_timed_pop_filtered (bus, GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE, GST_MESSAGE_ERROR | GST_MESSAGE_EOS);
Now, the pipeline is running. gst_bus_timed_pop_filtered() waits for execution to end and returns a GstMessage which is either an error or an EOS (End-of-Stream) message.
Handle messages
if (msg != NULL) {
  GError *err;
  gchar *debug_info;

  switch (GST_MESSAGE_TYPE (msg)) {
    case GST_MESSAGE_ERROR:
      gst_message_parse_error (msg, &err, &debug_info);
      g_printerr ("Error received from element %s: %s.\n",
          GST_OBJECT_NAME (msg->src), err->message);
      g_printerr ("Debugging information: %s.\n",
          debug_info ? debug_info : "none");
      g_clear_error (&err);
      g_free (debug_info);
      break;
    case GST_MESSAGE_EOS:
      g_print ("End-Of-Stream reached.\n");
      break;
    default:
      /* We should not reach here because we only asked for ERRORs and EOS */
      g_printerr ("Unexpected message received.\n");
      break;
  }
  gst_message_unref (msg);
}
```
If the message is GST_MESSAGE_ERROR, the application will print the error message and debugging information.
If the message is GST_MESSAGE_EOS, the application will inform to users that the audio is finished.
After the message is handled, it should be un-referred by _gst_message_unref()_.

### Clean up
```
gst_object_unref (bus);

gst_element_set_state (pipeline, GST_STATE_NULL);
gst_object_unref (GST_OBJECT (pipeline));
```
The _gst_element_get_bus()_ function added the bus that must be freed with _gst_object_unref()_.
Next, setting the pipeline to the NULL state will make sure it frees any resources it has allocated.
Finally, un-referencing the pipeline will destroy it, and all its contents.

### Special instruction:
To set the playback volume: please use the alsamixer or amixer tool. It depends on the audio system on the specific board. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsamixer
